# CS 5-6 Blocking
This is a student made Ad Blocker by Ayden and Shane
It is currently missing a lot of features of a normal ad blocker because Shane and I do not have experience in programming Chrome extensions.
This was made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Update 0.4:
    Connect the on/off switch to the backend
    Have the button change innerHTML, and CSS properties upon clicking
    Save previous states of button from when it was last closed
    Start using local.storage to transfer and update variables
    
Update 0.3:
    Developed a basic GUI to connect to the backend
    Made a main button that will be used for an on/off switch
    
Update 0.2: 
    Block a massive portion of ads upon extension turning on

What the future has in store for this adblocker:
    Blocking ad placements in HTML (Backend)
    Complete youtube blocking (Backend)
    Ability to turn some links on an off by will (Frontend & Backend)
    Refresh page specific button (Frontend)
    
    And many more...
